# data-structures-and-algorithms
Introduction to algorithm design and analysis. Graph algorithms, greedy algorithms, data structures, dynamic programming, maximum flows

1) classes, templates, the big 5, move semantics, rvalue references, type deduction). 
2) Time complexity: Θ, 𝑂 and Ω notation. Basic algorithm analysis. 
3) Arrays, linked lists, stacks, and queues 
4) Sorting (insertion sort, merge sort, quick sort, radix sort) 
5) Trees (binary search tree, heap, AVL tree) 
6) Hash tables and (maybe) skip lists 
7) Graphs
